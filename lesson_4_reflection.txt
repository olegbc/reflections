Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clones - when I have in mind to use origin as place I got clone from.
Fork - when I don`t want to push to place I forked, but want to have opportunity to push to my repository.
Branches - its another story, I`ll use it to split development of destinct features on project.
