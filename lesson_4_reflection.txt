Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clones - when I have in mind to use origin as place I got clone from.
Fork - when I don`t want to push to place I forked, but want to have opportunity to push to my repository.
Branches - its another story, I`ll use it to split development of destinct features on project.

What is the bentfit of havimng a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It gets opportunity to:
 - diff with local branches and get to know state with remote wherther local branche ahead, behind, up-to-date or out-of-sync;
 - fetch remote state of branch to local tracking branch and then merge it with local branches
 - to track state when saccessfuly pushed
