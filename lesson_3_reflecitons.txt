When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your word local?    
When you you work from few places(machines) or work in team on this project.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with yout remote repisitory?
I`m not always need to have up-to-date data, couse I can be in the middle of my development process and don`t need new info yet.
